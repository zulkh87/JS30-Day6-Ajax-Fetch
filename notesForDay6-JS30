fetch returns a promise (probably; it could just be a "thenable"*). A promise is something that will be either resolved or rejected at a later point in time (typically**). then is used to hook up a handler that will be called when the promise is resolved (and optionally when it's rejected, if you pass a second function into then; otherwise you'd use catch).

1-innerHtml

    sets all the html content inside the tag
    returns all the html content inside the tag
    includes styling + whitespaces

2-innerText

    sets all the content inside the tag (with tag wise line breaks)
    returns all html content inside the tag (with tag wise line breaks)
    ignores tags (shows only text)
    ignores styling + whitespaces
    if we have style:"visibility:hidden;" inside tag |_ innerText includes the styling -> hides content

3-textContent

    sets all the content inside the tag (no tag wise line breaks)
    returns all content inside the tag (no tag wise line breaks)
    includes whitespaces
    if we have style:"visibility:hidden;" inside tag |_ textContent ignores the styling -> shows content
    textContent has better performance because its value is not parsed as HTML.
